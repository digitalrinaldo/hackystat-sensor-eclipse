#summary Instructions on how to install the Eclipse Sensor.
#labels Featured

== 1.0 Prerequisites ==

This sensor is compatible with Eclipse 3.4. 

== 2.0 Downloading ==

Go to the [http://www.hackystat.org Hackystat Home Page]  and download the "Featured Download" with "sensors" in its name. (There is also a "services" featured download; you don't need that one.)

Unzip this file. Assuming you've downloaded the 8.0.1016 release, you will get a directory structure similar to the following:

{{{
hackystat-8.0.1016-sensors-bin/
                               hackystat-sensor-eclipse/
                                                      org.hackystat.sensor.eclipse_8.0.v20071016.jar

                             :
}}}

There will also be directories for other sensors as well. 

== 3.0 Installation ==

To install the Hackystat Eclipse sensor, exit any running Eclipse processes, then copy the org.hackystat.sensor.eclipse-(version).jar file illustrated above to the Eclipse plugins/ directory.

Then restart Eclipse. 

The sensor is now installed. The next step is to set your sensor preferences. 

== 4.0 Sensor Configuration ==

You will need to provide a Hackystat !SensorBase host, a !SensorBase account (i.e. email address), and a password in the Preference Settings for the Hackystat Eclipse Sensor. This generally involves registering with a !SensorBase host.  Contact your Hackystat administrator if you are unclear on how to do this. 

Once you have these three items of information, select the Window | Preferences menu, then select "Hackystat Sensor"  to display its Preference page, as illustrated below:

The Hackystat Eclipse Sensor will check the validity of your input after you click the *Apply* and/or *OK* buttons. The new preferences will take effect the next time you start up Eclipse.  

Note that the Eclipse sensor buffers data locally and "autosends" it after
the interval in minutes specified in this preferences page. Any buffered
data is always sent when Eclipse exits.  When testing the sensor, you may 
need to exit Eclipse in order to force data transmission.  

Use the !AutoSend Interval preference to change the frequency with which the Eclipse sensor sends data. In general, the default (5 minutes) is reasonably frequent without incurring noticable overhead on the IDE.

Note that the Eclipse sensor does not read any information from the sensorshell.properties file. 

== 5.0 Verify your installation ==

To confirm that data is being received by the !SensorBase, we recommend that you use the Sensor Data page of the !ProjectBrowser application. 

After installing the Eclipse sensor, open Eclipse, work briefly, and then exit Eclipse (to guarantee that the buffered data has been sent). 

Then login to the !ProjectBrowser, select the "Default" project, the current month and year, and press submit.  You should see a screen similar to the following appear:

http://hackystat-sensor-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/sensordata.gif

This screen shows that !DevEvent data was sent by Eclipse and this user on November 15, 2008.

Clicking on the "15: Eclipse" link pops up a modal window with details on the 15 sensor data instances:

If the !ProjectBrowser does not show your data, then recheck your settings in the Eclipse Preferences page.
