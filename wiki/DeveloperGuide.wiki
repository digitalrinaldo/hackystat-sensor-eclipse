This document introduces how to build a release of the Hackystat Eclipse sensor from source using Eclipse's plug-in development environment. 

= 1.0 Install required package =

The Hackystat Eclipse Sensor project is organized as a feature of Eclipse. You will need Eclipse to build, debug and run the system. 

|| Package || Version || Remark  || 
|| [http://java.sun.com/ Java]    || 5 or 6    || Eclipse must run on JRE 5 or 6 || 
|| [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] || [http://europa-mirror1.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.2.2-200702121330/index.php 3.2] or [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ 3.3]    || ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/ Sensorbase-uh] || 8.0   || || 
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-shell/ Sensorshell] || 8.0  || Update plugin\lib\sensorshell.java5.jar if necessary ||
  

= 2.0 Check out the sources =
Check out the sources from the trunk of the Google Project repository. The URL is:

http://hackystat-sensor-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

The [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-eclipse/source Hackystat Eclipse Sensor Source Page] has more instructions

= 3.0 Build a release using PDE =

In the checked out sources, you should see four folders named site, feature, plugin and images. 
|| *./site* || Defines the sensor-eclipse-site project project that organizes an update site for users to install the sensor using the *Update Manager* of Eclipse (See [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-eclipse/wiki/UserGuide UserGuide]). ||
|| *./feature* || Defines the sensor-eclipse-feature project that encapsulate the sensor as an Eclipse feature for ease of use. ||
|| *./plugin* || Defines the sensor-eclipse-plugin project that implement the Eclipse sensor for Hacksytat 8. ||
|| *./images* || Some screenshots used by [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-eclipse/wiki/UserGuide UserGuide] or [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-eclipse/wiki/DeveloperGuide DeveloperGuide]. || 

== 3.1 Import projects ==

Import the above three predefined projects into your Eclipse IDE. Note that you must open the feature and plugin projects in order to build a release. 

== 3.2 Build a release ==
All you need is the Eclipse PDE. 
  * Expand directory tree of the sensor-eclipse-site project 
  * Open site.xml
  * In the *Update Site Map* page, click the *Build* button or *!BuildAll* button to build a release. Eclipse will automatically update the release files located in the *./site* folder.
  * Commit the release to the SVN repository if you are allowed to do so.  

= 4.0 Debug the sensor as an Eclipse application =

You can run/debug the sensor as an Eclipse application if desired. 
  * Start sensorbase service (See [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/wiki/DeveloperGuide UserGuide] for instructions)
  * Open the sensor-eclipse-plugin project
  * In the main menu, select *Run* | *Run As* || *Eclipse Application* to launch a new Eclipse for debugging. 
  * Do some development in the newly opened Eclipse IDE. You can check the Hackystat log, console output, or Eclipse's Error Log for troubleshooting. Or you can launch the plugin   in debug mode.
