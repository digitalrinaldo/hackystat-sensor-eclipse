This User Guide provides instructions on how to install, configure, and run the Hackystat Eclipse sensor. The Eclipse sensor collects sensor data regarding developer activities using the Eclipse IDE. In the following table, the bold-faced column names are the sensor data property names.

= 2.0 Installation =

This section describes how to install the Hackystat Eclipse Sensor using Eclipse's update manager.

== 2.1 Eclipse ==

This sensor is compatible with Eclipse 3.3. You will either use the *Feature Update Manager* to install the sensor (Option A) or use the released zip file for manual installation (Option B). 

== 2.2 Feature Installation (Option A) ==

  # Select the menu Help | Software Updates | Find and Install.  Eclipse will display the Feature Updates window. 
  # Check "Search for new features to install" and click the "Next" button to display the Update Sites To Visit window. 
  # Click the "New Remote Site ..." button to display the New Update Site window. 
  # Enter Hackystat Eclipse Sensor as the site name and http://hackystat-sensor-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/site/site.xml as the site URL.  
  # Click "OK" to confirm the entered information.
  # Click "Finish". Eclipse will then locate the Hackystat Eclipse Sensor, and display the Search Results window.
  # Check the Hackystat Eclipse Sensor box, and click "Next" to display the License window. 
  # Accept the License terms, and click "Next" to display the Installation window.
  # Click "Finish" to start the download of the sensor. When complete, the Feature Verification window will appear. 
  # Click "Install" to install the (unsigned) feature. After installation, the Install/Update window will appear, which will ask you if you want to restart or not. 
  # Click "Yes" to restart Eclipse and complete the installation process. 

== 2.3 Manual Installation (Option B) ==
  # Download the feature release from the home page.
  # Unzip it to your <directory of the installed eclipse>.

= 3.0 Sensor Configuration =

== Sensor Settings ==

You will need to provide a Hackystat !SensorBase host, a !SensorBase account (i.e. email address), and a password in the Preference Settings for the Hackystat Eclipse Sensor. This generally involves registering with a !SensorBase host.  Contact your Hackystat administrator if you are unclear on how to do this. 

Once you have these three items of information, select the Window | Preferences menu, then select "Hackystat Sensor"  to display its Preference page, as illustrated below:

http://hackystat-sensor-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/EclipseSensorPreference.jpg

The Hackystat Eclipse Sensor will check the validity of your input after you click the *Apply* and/or *OK* buttons. The new preferences will take effect the next time you start up Eclipse.  Note that the Eclipse sensor buffers data locally, so you will not see the data sent immediately to the !SensorBase host. To guarantee transmission, exit Eclipse. 

To confirm that data is being received by the !SensorBase, we recommend the use of the [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-sensordataviewer/ Sensor Data Viewer].
