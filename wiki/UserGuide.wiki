The InstallationGuide provides instructions on how to install and configure the Hackystat Eclipse sensor. 

After that is accomplished, there is not much to do to "use" the sensor: it collects data automatically and sends it to the server. 

Here is a table indicating the kinds of data this is collected by this sensor.
